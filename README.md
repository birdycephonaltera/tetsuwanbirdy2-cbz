Tetsuwan Birdy II Translations (cbz extension repo)
==============

This is a mirror of [tetsuwanbirdy2](https://github.com/birdycephonaltera/tetsuwanbirdy2), except all the files have .cbz extension for manga reader support (e.g. [CDisplayEx](http://cdisplayex.com)).

If you've arrived here directly, then read the corresponding blog at:

Questions or comments can be addressed to me via a comment on the blog or [@tetsuwanbirdy](https://twitter.com/tetsuwanbirdy).
